This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `General info`

This was a project completed over the period of five days, subsequent to five days spent building a back-end express server (link to repo below). The aim was to create a website in a similar vein to reddit, where users can read and interact with articles, via the medium of voting and commenting.

### `clone repository from github`

### `Run command npm i in terminal to install dev dependencies`

### `npm start to run development server`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `Delete build folder`

Delete the build folder from the netlify folder and move the newly created build file into the netlify folder.

### `See package.json for dependencies that have been deployed`

### `Link to API`
